# CS 450 -Computer Graphics- Project GIFs (No Code)

- No code - only GIFs showing the programs running from Visual Studio.
- Projects coded in C++/ OpenGL demonstrating lighting, textures, keytime animations, and object transformations.
- GIFs are bad quality as GitHub limits each to 10 MB.

# Final Project

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvKFpJYDZkw
- A Solar System model coded in C++ in OpenGL, using fragment, vertex shaders, 8k planet textures and lighting. 
- Added 150 random asteroids to main asteroid belt and another 150 for kuiper belt, 8 planets, Pluto, 4 moons, and a galaxy skybox with vertex and fragment shaders.
- Added clouds to earth by blending two vec4 textures (rgba) textures together in the fragment shader.  Used a vec2 variable to translate the clouds over the Earth's surface.
- Used Kepler's third law to calculate realistic orbital periods for planets based on their orbital radii.
